Let it Snow
===================

Let it Snow Plugin for Monstra CMS

After installation you can configure this plugin through admin panel.

Available options:

* Snow Color - Set your snow color. e.g. white, red, blue, etc...
* Flakes max active - Sets the limit of "falling" snowflakes (eg. moving on the screen, thus considered to be active.)
* Twinkle Effect - Allow snow to randomly "flicker" in and out of view while falling.
* Follow Mouse - Allows snow to move dynamically with the "wind", relative to the mouse's X (left/right) coordinates.
* Snow Stick - Allows the snow to "stick" to the bottom of the window. When off(false), snow will never sit at the bottom.
* Freeze on blur - Stops the snow effect when the browser window goes out of focus, eg., user is in another tab. Saves CPU, nicer to user.
* Flakes Max - Sets the maximum number of snowflakes that can exist on the screen at any given time.
* Target Element - An HTML element which snow will be appended to (default: document body.) Can be an element ID string eg. 'myDiv'.
* Position Fixed - If enabled(true), snow not affected by window scroll. May increase CPU load, disabled(false) by default.
